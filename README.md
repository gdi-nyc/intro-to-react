This curriculum is adapted from William Hoang's Intro React material, taught by Grace Tan and Aurelia Moser in the New York City Chapter. The course is meant to be taught in two, two-hour sections.

### Course description

React is a Javascript library built by Facebook and Instagram to create user interfaces, self-purported as the "V" (view) in MVC. It's designed to build large applications with mutable data, and you can learn more about its [design and purpose here](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html).

In this class, we'll explore the core features of React as we build a demo application with very little code.

This two-part workshop will cover:

* React setup
* Dynamic UIs with React
* Core features
* Reusable Components + Props

### Prerequisites:

This course will presume some prior knowledge of HTML/CSS and some Javascript. A willingness to use the command line is necessary; we will be running some commands for installation, changing directories, and running a local server to test and run code. Do not be intimidated, the course will walk you through all steps and you will be provided with sample code to follow along!

### Tech requirements:

* Your laptop (with administrative privileges for installing software and a command line interface)
* A modern web browser - either Chrome or Firefox with Firebug installed.
* A text editor. We recommend Sublime Text 2 (free; available for Mac, PC, and Linux).
* Your power supply
